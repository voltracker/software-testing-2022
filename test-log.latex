      Requirement & Issue & Fix \\ \hline \hline
      F8 & Function is only checking length of string, not that all characters are digits & Change length check to a regex that only matches digits of length 16 \\ \hline
      F8 & no issue, fully completed tests, all pass. & n/a \\ \hline 
      F7 & Test kept failing due to an invalid date when it should have been valid. When generating random dates, they were being passed in with the format \texttt{9/23} or \texttt{2/23} rather than \texttt{09/23} or \texttt{02/23} & prepend a \texttt{0} when the generated month was less than \texttt{10} \\ \hline
      F7 & no issue, fully completed tests, all pass. & n/a \\ \hline 
      F9 & no issue, fully completed tests, all pass. & n/a \\ \hline 
      F2 & no issue, fully completed tests, all pass. & n/a \\ \hline
